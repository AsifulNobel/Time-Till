### Description
A chrome extension for setting countdown timer for events and showing the timers in **newtab** page. Using this, users should be able to manually input event dates and also link events from services e.g. Google Calendar.

### Motivation
I needed a countdown timer for events to remind me about upcoming events i.e. Assignment Deadlines, Birthdays etc. Some might argue a installing a mobile app would have been easier, but I spend most of my awake time on my laptop using browser and other applications rather than on mobile. So building a browser extension was the more suitable solution for my need. Moreover, I wanted to brush up my JS knowledge. :smile:

### Installation
Clone this repository with following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AsifulNobel/Time-Till
```

Then start Chrome browser and go to **extensions** page. Select **Developer Mode** and then click on *Load unpacked extension...*. When directory chooser dialog appears, choose the director where you cloned the repository.
